    <p>Greyhound Pets of America Inc. is a national non-profit organization dedicated to finding responsible homes for retired racing greyhounds. Greyhound Pets of America is the largest non-profit greyhound adoption group. Over 65,000 greyhounds have been adopted into loving homes since GPA first opened its doors in 1987.  GPA/Houston operates a shelter within The Best Friends Pet Care in Houston, Texas.

    <p>Since there is never a lack of dogs waiting for adoption, potential adopters have the opportunity to meet and get to know several dogs. It is our goal to find the perfect match for both pet and owner. Except for several part-time kennel employees, we are an all volunteer organization. With over 500 active members in the Houston area, our aim is to inform the public on what excellent, loving pets these noble dogs make.
